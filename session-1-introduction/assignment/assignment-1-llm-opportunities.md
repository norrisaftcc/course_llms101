# Assignment 1: LLM Opportunity Assessment

## Objective
Document 5 potential applications for LLMs in your organization, demonstrating understanding of capabilities, limitations, and business value.

## Due Date
Before Session 2 (one week)

## Instructions

### Part A: Organizational Context (Optional but helpful)
Provide brief background:
- Industry/Sector:
- Organization size:
- Key business challenges:

### Part B: Five LLM Opportunities

For EACH of the 5 opportunities, complete the following template:

#### Opportunity #[1-5]: [Descriptive Name]

**1. Current Process Description**
- What is done today?
- Who is involved?
- How long does it take?
- What are the pain points?

**2. LLM Enhancement Opportunity**
- How could an LLM improve this process?
- Which LLM capabilities would be leveraged?
- What specific tasks would the LLM handle?

**3. Expected Benefits**
- Time savings: [Estimated hours/week]
- Cost savings: [Estimated $/month]
- Quality improvements: [Specific metrics]
- Other benefits: [List any additional advantages]

**4. Implementation Complexity**
Rate from 1-5 (1=Simple, 5=Complex):
- Technical difficulty: [ ]
- Change management: [ ]
- Data/Security concerns: [ ]
- Integration requirements: [ ]

**5. Potential Risks & Mitigation**
- Risk 1: [Description] → Mitigation: [Strategy]
- Risk 2: [Description] → Mitigation: [Strategy]
- Risk 3: [Description] → Mitigation: [Strategy]

**6. Success Metrics**
- How will you measure success?
- What KPIs would you track?
- Timeline for expected results?

### Part C: Prioritization Matrix

Create a 2x2 matrix plotting your 5 opportunities:

```
High Impact │ Quick Win | Strategic
           │    #?     |    #?
           │           |
─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─│─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─│─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─
           │           |
Low Impact │ Low Pri   | Complex
           │    #?     |    #?
           │           |
           └───────────┴───────────
            Easy      Hard
            Implementation
```

### Part D: Recommended First Project

Based on your analysis:
1. Which opportunity should be piloted first?
2. Why this choice?
3. What resources would you need?
4. Proposed timeline for pilot?

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assignment will be evaluated on:

1. **Understanding of LLM Capabilities** (25%)
   - Realistic assessment of what LLMs can/cannot do
   - Appropriate matching of capabilities to use cases

2. **Business Value Analysis** (25%)
   - Clear articulation of benefits
   - Realistic cost/time savings estimates
   - Meaningful success metrics

3. **Risk Assessment** (25%)
   - Identification of genuine risks
   - Practical mitigation strategies
   - Consideration of ethical/privacy concerns

4. **Strategic Thinking** (25%)
   - Quality of prioritization logic
   - Feasibility of recommendations
   - Change management considerations

## Submission Format

- PDF or Word document
- 5-8 pages maximum
- Professional formatting
- Include any supporting diagrams/charts

## Example Opportunity (for inspiration)

**Opportunity: Automated Customer Email Response Drafting**

*Current Process*: Customer service reps manually draft responses to routine inquiries, taking 10-15 minutes per email.

*LLM Enhancement*: Use LLM to generate initial response drafts based on inquiry type, which reps review and personalize.

*Benefits*: 
- 70% reduction in response time
- Consistent tone and quality
- Reps handle 3x more inquiries

*Risks*: 
- May generate inappropriate responses → Human review required
- Customer data privacy → Use secure API endpoints
- Over-reliance on automation → Maintain human oversight

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: Avoid generic opportunities like "improve communication"
2. **Think End-to-End**: Consider the entire workflow, not just one step
3. **Start Small**: Focus on contained, measurable processes
4. **Consider Users**: Think about change management and adoption
5. **Be Realistic**: Don't overestimate capabilities or underestimate complexity

## Questions?

Bring questions to office hours or post in the course forum.

Remember: The goal is to think critically about real applications in your specific context, not to create a perfect implementation plan.

Good luck!
