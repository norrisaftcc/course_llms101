**20-29 checked**: Moderate readiness - focus on critical gaps first
**Below 20**: Low readiness - significant preparation needed

## Priority Action Items

Based on your assessment, identify top 3 actions:

1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

## Next Steps

If ready (30+ checks):
- Proceed with pilot project selection
- Begin API access setup
- Start prompt engineering training

If preparation needed (<30 checks):
- Focus on highest-impact gaps
- Build stakeholder alignment
- Develop missing processes
- Schedule readiness review
