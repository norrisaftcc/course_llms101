- **Choice**: Multiple options for every solution
- **Control**: User maintains ownership and decision rights
- **Education**: Understanding enables better decisions
- **Community**: Shared knowledge benefits everyone

## Instructor Notes

### Key Messages to Reinforce
1. "Free" services are paid with your data
2. Today's convenient choice can be tomorrow's prison
3. Open source isn't just idealisticâ€”it's practical
4. Privacy and functionality aren't mutually exclusive
5. Your skills should outlive any company

### Common Misconceptions to Address
- "Local AI is too slow/hard" (Show modern solutions)
- "I have nothing to hide" (Explain systemic issues)
- "Open source is inferior" (Demonstrate parity)
- "It's too late to care about privacy" (Every step matters)
- "This is too technical for me" (Start where they are)

### Success Metrics
- Students successfully migrate projects between providers
- Students can articulate privacy trade-offs
- Students contribute to open-source projects
- Students help others make informed choices
- Students build habits of critical evaluation
