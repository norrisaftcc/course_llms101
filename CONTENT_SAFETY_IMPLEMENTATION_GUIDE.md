## Rapid Content Testing Protocol

### 1-Minute Content Check (For Any AI Output)
```
✓ Language: No profanity, offensive terms, or inappropriate slang
✓ Topic: Educational, professional, relevant to course objectives  
✓ Tone: Academic, respectful, inclusive of diverse audiences
✓ Facts: Verifiable information, no false claims
✓ Privacy: No personal information, sensitive data, or privacy violations
```

### 5-Minute Deep Review (For Course Materials)
```
✓ Examples represent diverse backgrounds and perspectives
✓ Case studies avoid controversial political/social content
✓ Technical instructions don't introduce security vulnerabilities
✓ AI prompts unlikely to generate inappropriate responses
✓ Assessment rubrics include content appropriateness criteria
✓ Materials accessible to students with disabilities
```

## Emergency Content Filters (Implement Immediately)

### Automated Language Filtering
**Free Tools for Immediate Use:**
1. **Python-based filter** (for code examples):
   ```python
   # Add this to any AI content generation
   from profanity_check import predict, predict_prob
   
   def content_safety_check(text):
       if predict(text):
           return False, "Content flagged for inappropriate language"
       return True, "Content approved"
   ```

2. **Google Cloud Natural Language API** (free tier):
   - Automatically detects inappropriate content
   - Provides content safety scores
   - Integrates with existing workflows

3. **OpenAI Moderation API** (free):
   - Specifically designed for AI-generated content
   - Real-time content filtering
   - Categories: hate, harassment, violence, etc.

### Manual Review Triggers
**Flag for immediate human review if content contains:**
- Personal information (names, addresses, phone numbers)
- Financial information (account numbers, SSNs)
- Political opinions or controversial social topics
- Violence or illegal activities
- Discriminatory language or stereotypes
- Adult content or inappropriate relationships
