# Instructor Guide for CSC-113
## Teaching Philosophy & Core Principles

### The Big Idea
**"GitHub First, AI Always, Failure is Exercise"**

You're not teaching AI. You're teaching professional workflows using AI as the vehicle. By the end, students have better GitHub portfolios than most bootcamp graduates, genuine project management experience, and AI assistants they actually use.

### Core Teaching Principles

#### 1. GitHub IS Professional Development
- Students literally don't know any other way to submit work
- Everything goes through Issues → Branches → PRs → Merge
- Their little green squares are their attendance
- Protected main branch from minute one

#### 2. AI Use is Mandatory, Not Cheating
- Every assignment requires AI collaboration
- We grade HOW they use AI, not IF they use it
- "Kevin from IT" makes AI approachable
- Students document their prompts and iterations

#### 3. Productive Failure
- Module 2: Build something terrible on purpose
- "Failure is just exercise - delete the branch"
- Learn what works by experiencing what doesn't
- Celebrate spectacular failures publicly

#### 4. Real Skills, Real Titles
- Module 3: "You're doing UX Testing" (resume-ready)
- Module 4: "You're now a Project Manager" ($75K+ skill)
- Module 5-8: "You're leading development sprints"
- Every module maps to professional competencies

### The Student Journey

**Weeks 1-2**: From "What's GitHub?" to committing daily
**Weeks 3-4**: From "My AI is terrible" to "I fixed it with one change"
**Weeks 5-8**: From "I don't have a project" to "Here's my deployed solution"

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Never teach Git commands before GitHub web interface**
2. **Protect main branch religiously** - forces PR workflow
3. **Daily standups** - even if async, creates rhythm
4. **Peer reviews required** - builds community
5. **Public commitments** - students announce projects

### Managing Different Skill Levels

The course naturally accommodates variation:
- **Beginners**: Use templates, focus on process
- **Intermediate**: Build custom solutions
- **Advanced**: Create tools for the class

Everyone follows the same GitHub workflow. The code quality varies, the process quality doesn't.

### Assessment Philosophy

We assess:
- ✅ Process documentation
- ✅ AI collaboration quality
- ✅ Professional communication
- ✅ Portfolio presentation

We don't assess:
- ❌ Code perfection
- ❌ AI-free knowledge
- ❌ Traditional exams
- ❌ Attendance sheets

### Week-by-Week Energy

**Module 1**: High energy, lots of hand-holding, celebrate every commit
**Module 2**: Comedy gold - worst assistant awards, public failures
**Module 3**: "One simple trick" energy - transformation reveals
**Module 4**: Serious turn - "You're a PM now"
**Module 5-7**: Sprint energy - daily progress, building momentum
**Module 8**: Victory lap - demos, LinkedIn updates, job ready

### The Hidden Curriculum

Students learn without realizing:
- Version control is normal
- Documentation is required
- Peer review is helpful
- AI is a tool, not magic
- Process matters more than perfection

### Your Daily Routine

**Morning (15 min)**:
- Check GitHub org dashboard
- Review overnight commits
- Note struggling students

**Class Time**:
- 5 min standup
- 20 min demo/concept
- Rest is student work
- Circulate constantly

**Evening (10 min)**:
- Approve simple PRs
- Leave encouraging comments
- Update tracking sheet

### Crisis Management

**"GitHub is down"**: Switch to AI ethics discussion
**"I'm stuck"**: "Delete the branch, start fresh"
**"This is too hard"**: "Show me your last commit" (they've already succeeded)
**"AI isn't helping"**: "Document what you tried, let's debug together"

### The Payoff

By Module 8, students have:
- Professional GitHub profiles
- Custom AI assistants
- Completed projects
- Real PM experience
- UX testing experience
- Industry-standard workflows
- Actual confidence

They think they learned AI. They actually learned how to learn continuously.

### Remember

Your job isn't to be the expert. Your job is to facilitate discovery. When students ask complex questions, your response is: "Great question! Ask Kevin, document what he says, then let's discuss."

The course teaches itself if you trust the process.

*"We're not teaching them to code. We're teaching them to learn. The AI stuff is just the McGuffin."*
