# CSC-113 AI Fundamentals
## The GitHub-First, AI-Native Course

> *"Hello, Scholars! You're already using AI. Now let's build with it."*

### Course Philosophy
This isn't a course about AI theory - it's about AI practice. Students learn professional workflows from Day 1, building terrible assistants to understand good design, and finishing with portfolio-ready projects.

### Key Innovation: GitHub IS How You Code
- No traditional attendance - GitHub contributions are participation
- No academic exercises - real projects with real stakeholders  
- No AI detection - AI use is mandatory
- No exams - portfolio assessment

### 8-Week Journey
1. **AI - You're Already Doing It** - Recognition & GitHub setup
2. **Build a Bad Agent** - Productive failure & iteration
3. **Build a Pretty-Good Agent** - UX testing & transformation
4. **Discover Your Real Project** - Become a PM with AI advisors
5. **Design the Project** - Architecture & planning
6. **Project Sprint 1** - Build with AI teammates
7. **Project Sprint 2** - Refine & polish
8. **The Payoff** - Demo, ship, & future-proof
