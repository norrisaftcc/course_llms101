# Weeks 1-2: Learning GitHub & Scrum Through AI Assistant Development
## "You Can't Complete Your Feature Without These Skills"

### Core Learning Philosophy
Students learn project management and agile methodology **not as abstract concepts** but as **the only way to complete their work**. Every GitHub action and Scrum practice is introduced as "here's what you need to do to finish your assistant."

---

## Week 1: Sprint 1 - Administrative Assistant Feature

### **Day 1: Project Setup (The Only Way to Start)**
**Feature Goal:** "Create workspace for your AI assistant project"

#### Morning: "Every Developer Needs a Workspace"
**GitHub Concepts Learned Through Necessity:**

**Step 1: Repository Creation**
```
"To build your assistant, you need somewhere to store your work. 
Here's how developers do it:"

1. Create GitHub account (if needed)
2. Create repository: "my-ai-assistants" 
3. Initialize with README
4. Add description: "CSC-113 AI Assistant Development Project"
```

**Step 2: Issue Creation (Project Planning)**
```
"Before any developer writes code, they create an Issue describing what they're building:"

Navigate to Issues tab â†’ New Issue
Title: "Feature: Administrative Assistant"
Description template:
---
## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Assistant responds to basic administrative requests
- [ ] Response time is under 30 seconds
- [ ] Tone matches my communication style
- [ ] Can handle scheduling, planning, and organization tasks

## Definition of Done

---
```

**What Students Just Learned:**
- Repository as project workspace
- Issues as feature planning
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Definition of Done concept

#### Afternoon: "Professional Development Workflow"
**Branch Creation & Setup**

```
"No developer works directly on the main code. Here's the professional way:"

1. Create branch from Issue: "1-administrative-assistant"
2. Clone or edit in GitHub Codespaces/web interface
3. Create folder structure:
   /assistants
     /admin-assistant
       prompt.md
       test-results.md
       README.md
```

**What Students Learn:**
- Feature branching
- Project organization
- Working in isolation from main code

**Homework:** Write first draft of admin assistant prompt in `prompt.md`

### **Day 2: Sprint Development - Prompt Engineering**
**Feature Goal:** "Build and test your administrative assistant"

#### Morning: "Iterative Development Process"
**Scrum Concepts Through Daily Practice:**

**Daily Standup (5 minutes)**
Each student reports:
- What I completed yesterday: [Repository setup, initial prompt draft]
- What I'm working on today: [Prompt testing and refinement]
- Any blockers: [Gemini Flash access issues, unclear requirements]

**Sprint Work: Prompt Development**
```
Students work in their feature branch:

1. Edit prompt.md with initial assistant prompt
2. Test prompt in Gemini Flash web interface
3. Document results in test-results.md
4. Iterate based on results
5. Commit changes with descriptive messages
```

**Commit Message Learning:**
```
"Every change needs a clear description for your team:"

Good commit messages:
- "Add initial admin assistant prompt v1"
- "Fix scheduling response format issue"  
- "Update prompt to handle task prioritization"

Bad commit messages:
- "Update"
- "Fix stuff"
- "Changes"
```

#### Afternoon: "Testing and Quality Assurance"
**Testing Methodology Through Practice:**

**Test Cases Students Must Complete:**
```
Create test-results.md documenting:

Test 1: Basic Scheduling
Input: "Help me plan my Tuesday"
Expected: Organized response asking clarifying questions
Actual: [paste response]
Status: Pass/Fail/Needs Work

Test 2: Task Prioritization  
Input: "I have homework, work, and social plans. Help me prioritize"
Expected: Clear prioritization with reasoning
Actual: [paste response]
Status: Pass/Fail/Needs Work

Test 3: Quick Organization
Input: "My desk is a mess. Quick advice?"
Expected: Fast, actionable advice
Actual: [paste response]
Status: Pass/Fail/Needs Work
```

**What Students Learn:**

**The Hidden Curriculum Success:**
Students think they're "just building AI assistants" but they've actually mastered the foundational project management and development skills they'll use throughout their careers. The GitHub workflow and agile practices become second nature because they were learned as "the way you do real work" rather than abstract concepts.
