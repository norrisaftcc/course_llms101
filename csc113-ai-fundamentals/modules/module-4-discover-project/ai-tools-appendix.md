## The Free Tool Ecosystem

### ü§´ The Algorithm (Don't Tell Systems Analysis)
**What It Is**: Kevin 4.0 in disguise. The Systems Analysis students (the ones with colored lanyards) think it's some proprietary system. Let them believe.

**Access**: Through the campus portal (ask a friend in Systems Analysis to "show you The Algorithm")
**Limits**: Practically unlimited if you know the tricks
**Best For**: When you need Kevin but better and don't want to pay

**Secret Access Pattern**:
```
1. Log into campus portal
2. Navigate to "Research Tools"
3. Look for "Advanced Computational Resources"
4. It's just Gemini Pro with a fancy wrapper
5. The password is always "optimize2025"
```

**Pro Tip**: The colored lanyard students guard this jealously. Pretend you don't know it's just Kevin.

### üñ•Ô∏è Gemini CLI (The Power User's Secret)
**What It Is**: Command-line Gemini with surprisingly generous free limits

**Setup**:
```bash
npm install -g @google/generative-ai-cli

gemini config set model gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

**Free Limits**:

## Decision Framework

### Stay Free If:
- [x] Project is personal/academic
- [x] Time is flexible
- [x] Learning is primary goal
- [x] Privacy isn't critical

### Consider Paying If:
- [ ] Rate limits blocking progress
- [ ] Time is money
- [ ] Quality is critical
- [ ] Team collaboration needed
- [ ] API integration required

### Go Local If:
- [ ] Privacy is paramount
- [ ] Internet is unreliable
- [ ] Want unlimited usage
- [ ] Have decent hardware

## The Hidden Truth

Most students complete the entire course on free tools. The paid tiers are comfort, not necessity. The Algorithm alone (Kevin 4.0) could handle everything if you know it exists.

But sometimes, investing $20 during sprint weeks saves 20 hours. That's $1/hour for your time. Your call.

*Remember: The Systems Analysis students with colored lanyards think The Algorithm is special. Let them. We know it's just Kevin 4.0 with a fancy name. Use this knowledge wisely.*

*PS: If you see someone in a colored lanyard at 2 AM in the lab, they're probably just using Kevin too.*
