# Module 4: Discover Your Real Project
## Congratulations, You're Now a Project Manager!
### CSC-113 AI Fundamentals | Week 4

## Module Overview

**The Situation**: You've been promoted to Project Manager! 

**The Problem**: Nobody trained you for this role.

**The Good News**: Your two AI coworkers are ready to help, and you can hire a third if needed.

**Time Commitment**: 6-7 hours total (spread across 3 work days)
**Format**: Asynchronous project discovery
**New This Week**: You might build a PM-specific assistant

## Pre-Module Reality Check

### You're a PM Now (No One Prepared You)

This is actually how most people become project managers:
1. You were good at something technical
2. Someone said "you're in charge of the project"
3. You had no PM training
4. You figured it out (with help)

Your AI assistants are now your advisory board. They've seen you at your worst (Module 2) and helped you improve (Module 3). Now they'll help you figure out what to build.
