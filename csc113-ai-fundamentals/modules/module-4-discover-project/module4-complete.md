# Module 4: Discover Your Real Project
## Congratulations, You're Now a Project Manager!
### CSC-113 AI Fundamentals | Week 4

## Module Overview

**The Situation**: You've been promoted to Project Manager! 

**The Problem**: Nobody trained you for this role.

**The Good News**: Your two AI coworkers are ready to help, and you can hire a third if needed.

**The Mission**: Figure out what project you're actually managing. By Friday, you'll have identified a real problem to solve, validated its importance, and created your first project charter. Your assistants will help you navigate this like seasoned consultants.

**Time Commitment**: 6-7 hours total (spread across 3 work days)
**Format**: Asynchronous project discovery
**New This Week**: You might build a PM-specific assistant

### ðŸŽ¯ Resume Alert: Project Management Experience
You're about to conduct:
- **Project Discovery** - Identifying viable projects from multiple options
- **Stakeholder Analysis** - Understanding who cares and why
- **Requirements Gathering** - Defining what success looks like
- **Feasibility Assessment** - Determining what's actually possible
- **Project Charter Development** - Creating professional documentation

## Pre-Module Reality Check

### You're a PM Now (No One Prepared You)

This is actually how most people become project managers:
1. You were good at something technical
2. Someone said "you're in charge of the project"
3. You had no PM training
4. You figured it out (with help)

Your AI assistants are now your advisory board. They've seen you at your worst (Module 2) and helped you improve (Module 3). Now they'll help you figure out what to build.

## The PM Toolkit

### Decision-Making with AI Assistants

**The Advisory Board Pattern**:
1. Ask each assistant independently
2. Note agreements and conflicts
3. Ask follow-up questions
4. Synthesize into decision
5. Document rationale

**The Research Pattern**:
1. [Reformed] explores one angle
2. [Second] explores another
3. [PM Assistant] evaluates findings
4. You make final call

### Professional PM Language You're Now Using

- "Stakeholder alignment"
- "Scope creep"
- "Requirements gathering"
- "Success criteria"
- "Risk mitigation"
- "Resource allocation"
- "Project charter"
- "Acceptance criteria"

You're using these terms correctly in context. That's PM experience.

---

## Resources & Support

### When You're Stuck

**Can't choose between projects?**
- Ask assistants: "Which has clearest success criteria?"
- Consider: Which excites you most?
- Default to: Smallest scope, biggest impact

**Don't know stakeholders?**
- Start with yourself
- Add one hypothetical user
- Your instructor is always a stakeholder

**Scope feels too big?**
- Cut features, not quality
- Focus on ONE core function
- Remember: 4 weeks only

### PM Best Practices You're Learning

1. **Document everything** (you're doing this)
2. **Identify stakeholders early** (you did this)
3. **Define success clearly** (in your charter)
4. **Manage scope actively** (in/out lists)
5. **Communicate constantly** (via GitHub)

---

## Looking Ahead: Module 5 Preview

Next week, you're moving from PM to Architect. You'll:
- Design system architecture
- Create technical specifications
- Build detailed roadmap
- Set up development environment
- Prepare for Sprint 1

Your project is chosen. Your team is ready. Time to design what you're building.
