## Implementation Considerations

### Module 5 Challenges
- Students overwhelmed by design decisions
- **Solution**: Provide templates, use AI heavily
- Keep designs simple but professional

### Module 6 Challenges
- First real development sprint is scary
- **Solution**: Celebrate small wins, normalize failure
- "Commits over perfection"

### Module 7 Challenges  
- Polish feels less exciting than building
- **Solution**: Frame as "making it portfolio-ready"
- Peer testing adds energy

### Module 8 Challenges
- Presentation anxiety
- **Solution**: AI helps with script, multiple practice rounds
- Focus on journey not just result

---

## Resource Requirements

### Module 5 Needs
- Architecture diagram tools (or ASCII art)
- Tech stack decision matrices
- Specification templates

### Module 6 Needs
- GitHub Projects setup
- Development environment guides
- Sprint ceremony templates

### Module 7 Needs
- Deployment platform accounts
- Documentation templates
- Testing checklists

### Module 8 Needs
- Presentation slot scheduling
- Demo environment setup
- Portfolio templates

---

## Success Metrics Across Modules

### Quantitative
- Module 5: 3 design documents
- Module 6: 30+ commits
- Module 7: 40+ commits
- Module 8: 1 deployed project

### Qualitative
- Module 5: Confidence in design
- Module 6: "I built something!"
- Module 7: "It actually works well!"
- Module 8: "I'm ready for the next project"

## Notes for Full Implementation

1. **Keep professional skills mapping explicit** - Every module adds resume lines
2. **AI team remains central** - They're colleagues, not tools
3. **Celebration over perfection** - Ship something, anything
4. **Portfolio focus** - Everything builds toward employability
5. **Maintain humor** - "Untrained but figuring it out" theme continues

*These outlines maintain the course philosophy: Students think they're learning AI, but they're actually learning professional software development with AI as the excuse. By Module 8, they have genuine, marketable skills and a portfolio to prove it.*
