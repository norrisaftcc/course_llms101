# Bot Reform School
## Transforming Terrible Assistants into Valuable Teammates
### CSC-113 Module 3 Reference Guide

> *"Every terrible assistant is one thoughtful constraint away from being genuinely useful. The art is knowing which constraint to add, remove, or modify."*

---

## Reform School Introduction

Welcome to Bot Reform School, where dysfunctional assistants become productive team members. Each transformation follows the same pattern:
1. **Identify the core value** hidden in the dysfunction
2. **Add ONE strategic constraint** or redirect ONE behavior  
3. **Preserve personality** while improving utility
4. **Test in appropriate context**

**The Secret**: Don't try to fix everything. Find the one lever that transforms frustration into function.
