# Module 3: Build a Pretty-Good Agent
## Coworker Rehabilitation Program
### CSC-113 AI Fundamentals | Week 3

---

## Module Overview

Imagine if you could reprogram that annoying coworker. You know the one - they're clearly talented, but something about their approach drives everyone crazy. What if you could adjust just ONE thing about them and suddenly they'd become your favorite teammate?

**Disclaimer**: This only works on silicon-based coworkers. Do not attempt on carbon-based lifeforms. HR frowns upon that.

This week, you'll transform your terrible assistant into a valuable teammate through the ancient art of "finding the one thing that fixes everything."

**Time Commitment**: 6-7 hours total (spread across 3 work days)
**Format**: Asynchronous with transformation reveals
**New This Week**: Adding a second assistant for comparison

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Module 3, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** the single constraint causing dysfunction
2. **Modify** ONE aspect of your system prompt for maximum impact
3. **Preserve** personality while improving function
4. **Implement** a second assistant with complementary skills
5. **Document** transformation through before/after testing
6. **Create** an "AI Team Manual" for your assistants
7. **Conduct** UX (User Experience) testing and document findings

### ðŸŽ¯ Resume Alert
You're now conducting **UX Testing for AI Assistants**. This is a real, marketable skill. You're evaluating user interactions, documenting pain points, implementing solutions, and measuring improvements. Add "UX Testing - AI Applications" to your resume after this module.

## Pre-Module Reflection

### The Coworker Analysis Framework

Think about an annoying (human) coworker. What makes them annoying?
- They mean well but... [something specific]
- They're good at [skill] but terrible at [other skill]
- If they just [one change], they'd be amazing

Now think about your terrible assistant:
- What's their actual talent hiding under the dysfunction?
- What ONE behavior ruins everything?
- What would happen if you fixed just that?

---

## Day 1 (Monday): Diagnosis & Prescription

### Learning Goals
- Identify the core dysfunction
- Design the minimal intervention
- Preserve what makes them unique
- Plan transformation strategy

### Synchronous Session (Optional)
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Activity**: "Coworker Therapy Circle"
- Share your assistant's biggest problem
- Group brainstorms ONE fix each
- Vote on most likely to succeed

### Asynchronous Activities

#### Activity 1.1: The Diagnosis (45 minutes)

Create new repository branch: `3-rehabilitation`

Create file: `DIAGNOSIS.md`

```markdown
# Rehabilitation Plan for [Assistant Name]

## Patient History
- Created: Module 2
- Core Dysfunction: [specific problem]
- Failed Use Cases: [what they can't do]
- Hidden Strength: [what they're actually good at]

## Symptoms Analysis

### The Annoying Coworker Test
If [Assistant] was a human coworker, they'd be the one who:
- [Specific annoying behavior]
- [Another annoying behavior]
- [The thing that makes people avoid them]

### Root Cause Analysis
The REAL problem isn't [surface issue], it's [deeper issue].

Evidence:
1. When asked [X], they [problematic behavior]
2. When needing [Y], they [fail how]
3. When users want [Z], they [disappoint how]

## The Single Point of Failure
If I could change ONE thing: [be specific]

This would fix:
- [Problem 1]
- [Problem 2]
- [Problem 3]

This would preserve:
- [Good trait 1]
- [Good trait 2]
- [Their personality]

## Rehabilitation Hypothesis
By [specific change], [Assistant] will transform from [bad thing] to [good thing].

Success looks like:
- Users stop [rage behavior]
- Tasks actually [get completed]
- [Assistant] becomes useful for [specific context]

## The Mode Switch Possibility
Consider: What if users could say a "magic word" to temporarily get help?
- Like a coworker who becomes professional when the boss walks by
- Or a friend who gets serious when you say "I really need help"
- The personality stays, but adds an emergency mode
```

#### Activity 1.2: The Prescription (1 hour)

Create file: `TREATMENT-PLAN.md`

```markdown
# Treatment Plan

## The ONE Fix

### Current Behavior
```
[Current problematic part of system prompt]
```

### Reformed Behavior
```
[New version of that specific part]
```

### What This Changes
- Before: [specific bad behavior]
- After: [specific good behavior]
- Trade-off: [what might be lost]

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Identify the Lever
The key constraint/behavior to modify: [specific element]

**Consider the Mode Switch Pattern**:
- Default: Assistant keeps their personality
- Trigger phrase: "Professional mode" / "Help mode" / "Be serious" / [your choice]
- Temporary state: Becomes helpful for that task
- Return: Goes back to personality after

Example flow:
1. User: "Help me with my essay"
2. Assistant: [Usual terrible response]
3. User: "Serious mode please"
4. Assistant: [Actually helpful response]
5. Task done, personality returns

### Step 2: Minimal Intervention
Change ONLY:
- [ ] This specific instruction
- [ ] This behavioral pattern
- [ ] This response framework

Keep EVERYTHING else.

### Step 3: Test Protocol
Same 5 test cases from Module 2:
1. [Test scenario] â†’ Expected improvement: [what]
2. [Test scenario] â†’ Expected improvement: [what]
3. [Test scenario] â†’ Expected improvement: [what]
4. [Test scenario] â†’ Expected improvement: [what]
5. [Test scenario] â†’ Expected improvement: [what]

## Predicted Outcomes

### The Coworker Becomes
From: "The one who always [annoying thing]"
To: "The one who reliably [helpful thing]"

### New Use Case
[Assistant Name] will now be PERFECT for:
- Who: [specific user type]
- What: [specific task type]
- When: [specific situation]
- Why: [reason it works]
```

#### Activity 1.3: Peer Consultation (30 minutes)

Post in Discussion: "Rehabilitation Proposals"
- Share your ONE fix idea
- Get feedback: "Will this actually work?"
- Offer suggestions on 2 other proposals

### Success Metrics for Day 1

## Common Transformation Patterns

### Pattern Recognition
Without spoiling the specific fixes, here are patterns to consider:

**If too broad** â†’ Add focus
**If too narrow** â†’ Add flexibility
**If too harsh** â†’ Add empathy
**If too soft** â†’ Add structure
**If too random** â†’ Add consistency
**If too rigid** â†’ Add adaptability
**If too verbose** â†’ Add limits
**If too terse** â†’ Add detail

### ðŸ”‘ The Secret Word Hint
What if your annoying coworker had a "mode switch"? Imagine:
- They're being their usual terrible self
- You say a magic phrase like "Let's be direct" or "Professional mode please"
- They temporarily become helpful for that specific task
- Then they can return to their personality

Your assistant could work the same way:
- Default mode: Their quirky personality
- Secret word/phrase: Triggers helpful mode
- Task complete: Back to being themselves

This way you preserve what makes them unique while adding an escape hatch for when you really need help.

### The Minimal Intervention Principle
The best fix:
- Changes the minimum necessary
- Preserves maximum personality
- Creates maximum improvement
- Takes minimum effort

### The Coworker Test
Always ask: "If this was a human coworker, what ONE behavior change would make them great?"
