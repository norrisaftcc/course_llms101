## Assessment Framework

### The GitHub Grade
Your contribution graph tells the story:

```
ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ© = Consistent engagement (A)
ðŸŸ©â¬œðŸŸ© = Good engagement (B)
â¬œðŸŸ©â¬œ = Minimal engagement (C)
â¬œâ¬œðŸŸ© = Struggling (D)
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ = Missing (F)
```

### The Four Pillars (25% each)
1. **AI Partnership** - How well do you collaborate with Kevin/Claude?
2. **Problem-Solving** - How clearly do you document your process?
3. **Communication** - How helpful are your reviews and documentation?
4. **Critical Thinking** - How thoughtfully do you evaluate and iterate?

### Weekly Commitment
- **Minimum**: 3 green squares per week
- **Target**: 5 green squares per week
- **Overachiever**: Daily contributions

---

## Time Investment Reality Check

### Modules 1-5: Foundation Phase
- **Per Week**: 4-6 hours total
- **Per Day**: 1-2 hours (3 days)
- **Format**: Mostly async, self-paced

### Modules 6-8: Project Phase
- **Per Week**: 6-9 hours total
- **Per Day**: 2-3 hours (3 days)
- **Format**: Mix of sync check-ins and async work

### Total Course Investment
- **8 weeks Ã— ~6 hours** = 48 hours
- **Compare to**: 3-credit course = 45 hours in-class + 90 hours homework
- **This course**: More efficient, better outcomes

## Success Strategies

### For Students
1. **Set your 3 days and stick to them** (habit > heroics)
2. **Small commits daily** > huge commits weekly
3. **Ask Kevin/Claude for help** with everything
4. **Review peers' work** to learn faster
5. **Document everything** - future you will thank you

### For Instructors
1. **Check GitHub dashboard daily** (5 minutes)
2. **Intervene when squares go white** (early and often)
3. **Celebrate green streaks** publicly
4. **Share the contribution graphs** in class
5. **Your commits model the behavior**

---

## The Promise

**Week 1**: "I don't know what I'm doing"  
**Week 4**: "My assistants are actually helpful"  
**Week 8**: "I have a professional portfolio and AI teammates for life"

**The Secret**: By tracking work through GitHub, students learn professional workflows without realizing it. The AI is just the excuse to teach them how the industry actually works.
