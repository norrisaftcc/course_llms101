# Assignment 1: Your Professional GitHub Portfolio Begins

## Assignment Overview

**"Hello, Scholars!"** üéì

Welcome to CSC-113, where we're not just learning about AI‚Äîwe're learning how every tech company on Earth actually works. Before we touch a single AI tool, you're establishing your professional presence on GitHub. This isn't homework; this is literally how developers at Google, Microsoft, and every startup submit their work.

Your first assignment is deceptively simple but profoundly important: **create your GitHub account and build your professional profile README**. By the end of this assignment, you'll have:
- A professional GitHub account that will serve you throughout your career
- A polished profile README that introduces you to the tech world
- Your first commits in our course organization
- The foundation for your semester-long portfolio

**Why This Matters:** When employers look for developers, the FIRST thing they check is your GitHub profile. We're starting your professional portfolio on Day 1.

## Guidelines

### Part 1: GitHub Account Setup (15 minutes)
1. **Create your GitHub account** at [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Choose a professional username (you'll have this forever!)
   - Use your school email OR a professional email you check regularly
   - Enable two-factor authentication (required for our org)

2. **Accept the course organization invite** (check your email)
   - Join our `csc113-fall-2025` organization
   - This is where all your coursework will live

### Part 2: Create Your Profile README (45 minutes)

Your GitHub profile is your technical resume. Create a special repository with your username as its name (e.g., if your username is `sarah-codes`, create a repository called `sarah-codes`).

**Required Elements:**
- **Name & Introduction** (2-3 sentences about who you are)
- **Currently Learning** (mention CSC-113 and AI Fundamentals!)
- **Your "Foo"** - This is important! Your "foo" is something you're passionate about outside of coding. It makes you human and memorable. Examples:
  - üõ∏ UFOlogy enthusiast who's analyzed 200+ sighting reports
  - üéÆ Speedrunner with three world records in retro games
  - üèâ Rugby player who codes between matches
  - üé® Cosplayer who 3D prints their own armor
  - üçú Ramen connoisseur documenting every bowl in the city
- **How to Reach You** (GitHub is fine, or add LinkedIn/email if comfortable)
- **Fun Fact** (something unexpected about you)

**Template Flexibility Note:** If you're using a template and see fields like pronouns, location, or other personal information you'd prefer not to share, replace them with more about your "foo" or additional interests. Your profile should feel authentic to YOU.

### Part 3: Make It Shine (30 minutes)

Add some personality with:
- Emojis (but professionally - this is public!)
- A GitHub stats widget (optional but cool)
- Markdown formatting (headers, bold, lists)
- Maybe an ASCII art banner if you're feeling creative

### Part 4: Your First Professional Commits

1. Create at least 3 meaningful commits as you build your profile
2. Write clear commit messages (not "updated stuff" - be specific!)
3. Your commit history is public and permanent - make it professional

## Submission Requirements

Submit a single link to your GitHub profile (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username`) by [Due Date].

**Grading Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ GitHub account created and 2FA enabled (20%)
- ‚úÖ Joined course organization (20%)
- ‚úÖ Profile README includes all required elements (30%)
- ‚úÖ Creative personalization and "foo" integration (20%)
- ‚úÖ Professional commit messages (10%)

**Success looks like:** A profile that makes someone want to learn more about you, shows you're serious about tech, but also reveals you're an interesting human being.

**GitHub Basics:**
- [GitHub's Profile README Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [Awesome GitHub Profile READMEs](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) (for inspiration)

**Common Issues:**
- **"My README isn't showing!"** - Make sure your repository name EXACTLY matches your username
- **"I don't know Markdown!"** - That's fine! GitHub has a preview tab. experiment freely
- **"What if I pick the wrong username?"** - Choose carefully; changing it later breaks links
- **"I'm worried about privacy"** - Only share what you're comfortable with. Your "foo" can be general ("music lover" vs. specific band names)

**Getting Stuck?**
- Check our course Discord/Slack `#github-help` channel
- Office hours: [Days/Times]
- Remember: "Failure is just exercise" - if you mess up, delete and try again!

**Pro Tip:** Recruiters spend about 30 seconds on your GitHub profile. Make those seconds count. Your "foo" might be the thing that makes them remember you!

**Meta Note:** Yes, your instructor will be checking out everyone's foo. Looking forward to learning what makes each of you unique! üöÄ
