- Am I excited to work on this for 4 weeks?

**Feasibility Check**:
- Can I build an MVP in Week 6?
- Do I have access to needed data/APIs?
- Is the scope cuttable if needed?

**Portfolio Value**:
- Would I demo this in a job interview?
- Does this show multiple skills?
- Can I quantify the impact?

### Scope Management Tips

**Too Big?**
- Cut features, not quality
- Focus on one user journey
- Automate one thing really well

**Too Small?**
- Add data visualization
- Include multiple input methods
- Create better documentation

**Just Right?**
- Week 6: Basic version works
- Week 7: Actually useful
- Week 8: Portfolio-ready

## Your AI Team's Role

Remember, your assistants are your development team:

**Discovery Phase**: They help evaluate feasibility
**Design Phase**: They generate specifications
**Sprint 1**: They pair program with you
**Sprint 2**: They polish and document
**Demo**: They help prepare your presentation

You're not building alone. You're a PM with an AI team. Use them!

## The Hidden Truth

The best projects are often the simplest ones done well. A perfectly executed meeting summarizer beats a half-finished social network every time.

Pick something you'll actually use. Build it well. Ship it proud.
