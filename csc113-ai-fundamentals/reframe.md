Looking at these documents, I can see you have a comprehensive framework for an innovative AI Fundamentals course (CSC-113) that takes a radically different approach to AI education. Let me help you organize and integrate this material into a coherent structure.

## Core Philosophy Integration

The central insight across your documents is brilliant: **"We're not teaching them to code. We're teaching them to learn. The AI stuff is just the McGuffin."** This reframes the entire course around:

1. **Professional workflows (GitHub-first) as the foundation**
2. **AI collaboration as a core competency, not cheating**
3. **"Failure is just exercise" - iteration over perfection**

## Integrated Course Architecture

### The Progressive Learning Model
Based on your documents, here's how the pieces fit together:

**Weeks 1-2: GitHub Foundations**
- "Hello, Scholars!" introduction
- GitHub as documentation platform (not code repository initially)
- Daily standups establish professional communication
- SAGE (Study Assistant & Guide Engine) project begins

**Weeks 3-6: Specialization Tracks**
- **Prompt Masters Track**: Natural language AI collaboration
- **Code Builders Track**: Technical implementation with AI assistance
- Both tracks use identical GitHub workflows
- Introduction of AI personas (Kevin from IT, Friend Computer)

**Weeks 7-8: Community Integration**
- Real-world partner projects
- Cross-track collaboration
- Portfolio presentation to stakeholders

## AI Tools Integration Strategy

Based on your research, here's the optimal tool stack:

### Primary: Gemini 2.5 Flash Family
- **Flash-Lite** ($0.10/1M tokens) for basic tasks
- **Flash** ($0.30/1M tokens) for code generation
- **Pro** ($1.25/1M tokens) for complex reasoning only
- Implement cascade routing: start cheap, escalate as needed

### Backup Stack:
1. Local models (Ollama with Llama 3.2)
2. Hugging Face Spaces for deployment
3. GitHub Codespaces for development

## Assessment Framework Integration

Your AI-required assessment approach is revolutionary:

### Four Assessment Categories (25% each):
1. **AI Partnership Quality**: Prompt engineering sophistication
2. **Problem-Solving Process**: Documentation and iteration
3. **Professional Communication**: GitHub portfolio quality
4. **Critical Thinking & Ethics**: AI output evaluation

**Key Insight**: Grade the *collaboration with AI*, not *avoidance of AI*

## Practical Implementation Synthesis## Additional Integration Opportunities

Based on your documents, here are some key elements I'd recommend incorporating:

### 1. **The AI Persona System**
Your documents reference several AI characters that could enhance student engagement:

- **Kevin from IT**: The non-judgmental coding assistant (now with Gemini 2.5's "thinking mode")
- **Friend Computer**: Process-oriented, slightly bureaucratic but helpful
- **The Algorithm Node**: Community-focused AI for developer insights

These personas can be implemented as:
- Custom GPT configurations (when available to free users)
- Standardized prompt templates in your course materials
- Different "modes" students can switch between using browser extensions

### 2. **The "GameFAQs Style" Instructor Manual**
Your instructor operations manual with its gaming metaphors is brilliant for making complex course management approachable. Key elements to preserve:

- **Boss Fight scenarios** (rate limits, GitHub outages, student breakdowns)
- **Achievement systems** for student milestones
- **Speedrun strategies** for daily operations
- **Cheat codes** for emergency situations

### 3. **Community and Industry Integration**
Your documents emphasize real-world relevance:

- Partner organizations providing authentic projects
- Industry mentorship during capstone phase
- Alumni network for ongoing support
- Employer feedback loop for curriculum validation

## Implementation Priority

I'd suggest implementing in this order:

1. **Core GitHub workflow** (Weeks 1-2 focus)
2. **AI tool stack with cost optimization** (Gemini 2.5 cascade)
3. **Assessment framework** (AI collaboration grading)
4. **Specialization tracks** (Prompt Masters vs Code Builders)
5. **Community partnerships** (real-world projects)
6. **AI personas and gamification** (engagement enhancers)

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this integration, 
or help you develop particular components like the assessment rubrics, 
daily lesson plans, or crisis management protocols?
