### Post 2: The Problem/Solution
```
Last week I asked my team a simple question:

"How many hours do you spend on admin tasks?"

The answers were shocking:
• Email drafting: 5 hours
• Meeting summaries: 3 hours  
• Report writing: 4 hours
• Data analysis: 3 hours

That's 15 hours a week on repetitive work. 😱

Next [DATE], I'm showing everyone how to cut that to 3 hours using AI tools that are:
✅ Already available (many free)
✅ No IT approval needed
✅ No coding skills required

• Automated data collection

### Thread: Why You Need This
```
1/ Your coworker who always leaves on time? They're probably using AI tools.

Here's their secret (and how you can learn it for free)... 🧵

2/ They're not smarter or faster. They just know how to use:
• ChatGPT for emails
• Claude for analysis  
• Simple prompts for complex tasks

The best part? You already have access to these tools.

3/ Next [DATE], I'm teaching a free lunch session where you'll learn:
✓ Which AI to use for what
✓ Exact prompts that work
✓ Security best practices
✓ Real examples you can use immediately

4/ This isn't about replacing jobs. It's about:
• Getting home on time
• Focusing on meaningful work
• Stopping the repetitive grind
• Actually enjoying your job again

5/ Last session feedback:
"Saved 2 hours on my Monday report" - John
"Email responses take 5 mins now" - Lisa
"Why didn't I learn this sooner?" - Mike

6/ Details:
📅 [DATE] 12-1 PM
📍 [LOCATION]  
🍕 Free lunch
💺 Only 30 spots
🎯 Register: [LINK]

7/ Fair warning: This fills up fast. Last time we had a waitlist of 15 people.

Your time is worth more than repetitive tasks. Come learn how to reclaim it.

See you Tuesday! 🚀
