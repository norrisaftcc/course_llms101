# Elevator Pitch for AI Lunch & Learn

## 30-Second Version
"You know those 3 hours you spent last week writing reports and emails? What if I told you that could take 30 minutes? I'm teaching a free lunch session where you'll learn to use AI tools that are already available - no coding required. You'll see exactly how to automate the boring parts of your job. Next [DAY] at noon. Interested?"

## 60-Second Version
"How many hours do you spend each week on repetitive tasks - emails, meeting notes, reports? I used to waste 15 hours a week on that stuff. Now it takes me 3. 

I'm running a free lunch & learn next [DAY] where I'll show you exactly how to use AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to automate the boring parts of your job. No technical experience needed.

You'll see live demos of:
- Turning messy meeting notes into professional summaries in seconds
- Getting AI to write first drafts of emails and reports
- Analyzing data without knowing Excel formulas
- And the security mistakes to avoid

It's just 60 minutes, completely free, and you'll leave with at least 3 things you can use that afternoon. Space is limited to 30 people. Want me to save you a spot?"

## 2-Minute Version (For Team Meetings)
"Hey everyone, quick question - who here has used ChatGPT or any AI tool for work? [Wait for hands]

Interesting! So whether you have or haven't, I'm running a lunch session next [DAY] that I think could save everyone here about 10 hours a week. 

Here's the thing - most people are either scared of AI or they're using it wrong. They're worried about security, or they're getting mediocre results because they don't know how to ask for what they want.

In 60 minutes, I'll show you:
- Which AI tools to use and which to avoid (with actual cost comparisons)
- The exact words to use to get professional-quality outputs
- How to turn a week's worth of meeting notes into action items in 30 seconds
- What never to put into an AI (this is crucial for our company)
- Real examples from our industry

The best part? Everything I show you can be used immediately. No IT requests, no budget approvals, no complex setup. Just practical tools you can use this afternoon.

I'm limiting it to 30 people so everyone gets their questions answered. We'll have lunch provided, and you'll get a cheat sheet with all the prompts and examples we cover.

Who wants to learn how to get their evenings back?"
