Looking at these FOBSS resistances (Fear of Being Seen Struggling?), they're exactly what we'd expect in a mixed-ability, no-prerequisite AI course. Let me connect these to our course design strategies:

## **"I am afraid I will fail"**

**Preemptive Design:**
- **Portfolio-based assessment** removes single points of failure
- **Multiple success pathways** (non-coder vs. coder tracks) redefine "success"
- **GitHub Issues from Day 1** normalizes iteration and "failing forward"
- **Week 4 Reflection Issue: "SAGE Growing Pains"** explicitly celebrates learning from mistakes

**Built-in messaging:** "In this course, 'failure' is just data for your next iteration. Your GitHub history shows growth, not mistakes."

## **"I am overwhelmed"**

**Preemptive Design:**
- **Modular structure** with clear weekly objectives
- **GitHub Projects kanban boards** visualize progress ("To Learn" â†’ "Learning" â†’ "Mastered")
- **2+2 hour structure** (2 hrs concept, 2 hrs hands-on) creates predictable rhythm
- **Templates and scaffolding** reduce cognitive load

**The "energy audit" approach:** Week 2 check-in via GitHub Issue asking students to identify their "energy drains" and adjust accordingly.

## **"I don't believe it will work"**

**Preemptive Design:**
- **Day 1 win:** Teachable Machine demo - "You just built AI in 5 minutes"
- **Industry speakers** (Module 6) show real people using these skills
- **Previous student portfolios** as proof of concept
- **Low-stakes early projects** build confidence before complex work

## **"I don't know where to start"**

**Preemptive Design:**
- **GitHub Classroom templates** for every assignment
- **Detailed READMEs** with step-by-step instructions
- **"I Do, We Do, You Do" progression** makes starting points explicit
- **Peer mentoring** pairs those who've started with those who haven't

**The Issue template approach:**
```markdown
## ðŸš€ Starting Point Checklist
- [ ] I've read the README
- [ ] I've opened the template in Codespaces
- [ ] I've run the demo
- [ ] My next step is: ___
```

## **"I don't have the skills"**

**Preemptive Design:**
- **No prerequisites** explicitly stated and reinforced
- **Multiple tool options** (visual vs. code) for same objectives
- **Skills inventory** in Week 1 to identify existing strengths
- **"Expert for a day"** validates non-technical skills

**Reframe from Day 1:** "You have skills we need - domain expertise, critical thinking, communication. We'll add AI tools to your existing toolkit."

## **Structural Interventions**

### **Week 1 "Resistance Inoculation"**
Create a Discussion post where students share their concerns. Senior students or alumni respond with their experiences. Normalize the resistance.

### **Bi-weekly "Temperature Checks"**
GitHub Issue templates for self-assessment:
```yaml
name: Bi-weekly Check-in
about: How are you doing?
body:
  - type: dropdown
    label: Energy Level
    options: [Overwhelmed, Challenged, Comfortable, Bored]
  - type: textarea
    label: What's working?
  - type: textarea  
    label: What's blocking you?
```

### **The "Failure Resume" Assignment**
Week 4 assignment: Document a learning failure and what it taught you. Share in Discussions. Instructor goes first with their own AI learning failures.

### **Progressive Complexity with Escape Hatches**
Every assignment has three levels:
- **Foundation:** Can complete with templates/heavy scaffolding
- **Standard:** Expected level with moderate support
- **Stretch:** For those who want extra challenge

Students choose their level without penalty.

## **Messaging Throughout**

### **Syllabus Language:**
"This course assumes you've never coded and might be skeptical about AI. That's perfect - we need critical thinkers, not just builders."

### **Assignment Instructions:**
Always include: "If you're stuck for more than 20 minutes, create an Issue tagged 'help-wanted' - getting unstuck quickly is a professional skill."

### **Grading Philosophy:**
"You're graded on growth and engagement, not perfection. Your GitHub history should show evolution, not expertise."

Would you like me to develop specific interventions for any of these resistance points? The GitHub-first approach actually gives us amazing tools for addressing these proactively!
