# Content Standards

## Academic Environment Standards
This course uses industry-standard AI tools with default safety settings appropriate for professional and academic environments.

## Approach
- We rely on the built-in safety features of AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- Content is expected to maintain professional standards suitable for a college classroom
- Students are adults who will encounter and must learn to evaluate AI outputs critically

## If Issues Arise
Should any inappropriate content appear during course activities:
1. Treat it as a learning opportunity about AI limitations
2. Document the incident for course improvement
3. Reference university's existing academic conduct policies

## Student Expectations
Students are expected to:
- Use AI tools professionally and responsibly
- Report any concerning outputs to instructors
- Understand that evaluating AI output quality and appropriateness is part of the learning process
